Software Design Document Summary
Client Overview:
The Gaming Room is a company that developed a popular Android game called Draw It or Lose It. The game involves teams competing to guess what is being drawn from a library of stock images within a set time limit. The Gaming Room wanted to expand the game to a web-based platform accessible via web browsers on desktops and mobile devices.

Software Requirements:
The Gaming Room required the following:

Platform Expansion: Make the game accessible via web browsers on desktops and mobile devices.
Core Gameplay Mechanics: Maintain the core gameplay of guessing stock drawings within a set time limit.
Team Structure: Support the creation and management of multiple teams, each with multiple players.
Unique Naming: Ensure unique names for games and teams to avoid conflicts.
Web-Based Application: Develop a web-based application accessible via standard web browsers.
Singleton Instance: Ensure only one instance of the game exists in memory at any given time.
Real-Time Validation: Implement real-time validation for the uniqueness of game and team names.
Scalability: Design the application to handle multiple concurrent users efficiently.
Session Management: Implement session management to handle user sessions securely and efficiently.
Database Integration: Integrate with a database to store game, team, and player information persistently.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is responsive across various devices and screen sizes.
Self-Assessment
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I provided a comprehensive and clear evaluation of different operating platforms, considering both server-side and client-side requirements. The documentation clearly outlined the requirements, constraints, and recommendations, ensuring that the client’s needs were thoroughly addressed.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through a design document helped in understanding the entire system architecture and the interrelationships between different components. It allowed me to think through the requirements and constraints, leading to a more structured and well-thought-out approach to coding.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the section on Development Tools to provide more detailed comparisons of specific tools and IDEs for each platform. Including more detailed pros and cons, user experiences, and case studies could further justify the chosen tools and environments.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing their business and technical requirements, ensuring that the design met their expectations for expanding the game to multiple platforms. It’s crucial to consider the user’s needs to ensure that the final product is functional, user-friendly, and aligns with the client’s goals, ultimately leading to user satisfaction and project success.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached software design by:

Gathering Requirements: Thoroughly understanding the client's needs and constraints.
Evaluating Platforms: Assessing the characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses of different platforms.
Creating UML Diagrams: Visualizing the system architecture and relationships between components.
Developing a Domain Model: Defining the key entities and their interactions.
Providing Recommendations: Offering informed suggestions based on the evaluation.
In the future, I would use strategies like:

User Personas: Creating detailed user personas to better understand user needs.
Prototyping: Developing prototypes to validate ideas and get early feedback.
Agile Methodologies: Using iterative and incremental development to adapt to changing requirements.
Collaborative Design: Engaging with stakeholders throughout the design process to ensure alignment with business goals.
